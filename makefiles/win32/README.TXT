Visual Studio 2019 is the current reference version and the "norm.sln" file has support
for both 64- and 32-bit builds in Debug and Release configuration.

A Visual Studio solutions file and associated .vcproj files are
included as a convenience for those using earlier versions of visual
studio (2008 and 2010): Norm-2008.sln
