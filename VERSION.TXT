			           NORM Version History


Version 1.5.9 (in progress)
=============
    - Added "normCast" file send/receive example 
    - Protolib ProtoTimer fix for "long" timeout intervals

Version 1.5.8
=============
    - Modified waf build to build pkg-config file.cThanks to Luca Boccassi
       for this and some other patches for Gnu/Hurd, etc.)

Version 1.5.7
=============
    - Fixed issue with NormSession::SenderRemoveAckingNode() method where
      the removed NormAckingNode instance was not being properly deleted.
      (Thanks to Chad Gioia)
    - Fixed bug in normPrecoder (npc) when building on 64-bit architectures
      (Thanks to Leon Meyer)
    - Fixed bug in JNI NormNode.getAddress() method where an "unsigned short" 
      type was used instead of "UINT16" to receive the port portion of the
      address. (Thanks to Jame Nguyen)
    - Reduced warnings, added gnu and other build options to 'waf' wscripts
      (Thanks to Luca Buccassi)
    - Greatly improved high speed performance via enhancements to Protolib
    - Fixed bugs related to coding block id wrapping for very long-lived
      (or very high speed) NORM sessions.
    - Added NormSocket API extension in "norm/examples" that provides a 
      sockets-like API and client-server connection-oriented paradigm
      for using NORM. This currently supports a byte-stream service 
      for both multicast and unicast using NORM_OBJECT_STREAM.  This API
      extension is still work in progress and will be expanded to include
      message-stream service support as well as NORM's file/data object
      modes.  The "norm/examples/normClient.cpp" (and "normServer.cpp)
      illustrates use of the the API extension defined in
      "norm/examples/normSocket.h"
    - Added "normStreamer" example that provides the same function as the
      "normMsgr" example except using NORM_OBJECT_STREAM.
    - The bug fixes and performance enhancements make this a key update.
      The NORM Developer's Guide is not yet updated to described some of
      the new API features added.
    - Added APIs to iterate through sender "Acking Node List" to determine
      who has and who has not acknowledged a watermark acknowledgement
      request.
    - Added NormSetAutoAckingNodes() call with NormTrackingStatus to 
      automate detection of new group members.  The Acking Node List
      iterator function NormGetNextAckingNode() can be used to learn
      who has joined and the NORM_ACKING_NODE_NEW provides notification
      to the application of new members.
    - The 'waf' build scripts assign the current version number to
      the NORM shared library built for better version control/tracking.

Version 1.5r6
=============
    - Fixed Protolib ProtoBitmask bug for NDEBUG (release) builds.
      This is an IMPORTANT fix! (Thanks to Deepak Pengoria and 
      Kirill Kropivyanskiy)
    - Fix to use of gmtime() call in normApp.cpp for WIN32 builds

Version 1.5r5
=============
    - Added NORM_REMOTE_SENDER_RESET event to notify app when the sender
      has been reset due to instance id, etc change
    - Fixed possibly critical issue in Protolib ProtoDispatcher where
      threaded dispatcher use (as the NORM API uses) could possibly result 
      in timers not being serviced properly.  Most likely the issue could
      only occur under certain, heavier NORM API usage patterns.  Nonetheless,
      this is an important fix. (Thanks to Michael Savisko of Arris).
    - Fixed FreeBSD build (Thanks to Hans Duedal)
    - Changed from 'b' (build)  numbering schema to 'r' (release) to reduce
      confusion with respect to "beta" versus "stable" releases.
    - Note there are some "in-progress" API extensions in this release that
      are not yet described in the developer's guide documentation. 
     
Version 1.5b4
=============
    - Corrected change in behavior of non-blocking version of 
      NormGetNextEvent() call to be consistent with documentation

Version 1.5b3
=============
    - Added API functions to support integration of NORM into ZeroMQ
    
Version 1.5b2
=============
    - Fixed bug with "graceful" stream closure when the sender application
      did not first flush the stream before calling NormStreamClose()
    - Added NORM_TX_FLUSH_COMPLETED notification for active stream
      flushes, including the end of transmission flush when a stream
      has been gracefully closed.
    - Added NORM_SYNC_STREAM sync policy that is equivalent to NORM_SYNC_CURRENT
      but attempts to sync to _start_ of stream (byte offset 0)
    - Fixed issue with ackowledged, graceful stream closure to allow application
      to choose to reset watermark before closing stream. The app needs to close
      streams that remain unacknowledged at closure (i.e. catch TX_WATERMARK_COMPLETED
      notification check acking status).  Acknowledged, graceful shutdown streams,
      are automatically closed.
    - Fixed issue with compilation for NormObjectSize constructor, MSB(), and LSB()
      methods on 32-bit systems.  (Thanks to Bill Skiba).

Version 1.5b1
=============
    - Rolled up all of the features described in Version 1.4b4 below
      as a new "stable release" even though some minor documentation
      issues are pending.
    - Also includes the beginnings of code for "auto population" of
      the sender acking node list for easier (less precoordination)
      invocation of ACK-based flow control, etc

Version 1.4b4
=============
    - Added option to set NORM receiver "rx cache count max", i.e. the 
      maximum number of pending object for which the receiver will keep
      state (per sender).  The "NormSetRxCacheLimit()" API call was added
      to control this option.
    - Implemented timer-based flow control so that NORM sender apps will not
      force purge of old buffered objects (or stream data) for which there is
      "recent" NACK activity.  What is considered "recent" is based upon
      "flowControlFactor*GRTT_sender*(1 + backoffFactor)".  Note that a 
      "flowControlFactor" of 2.0 is default, but can be adjusted.  A
      new API call "NormSetFlowControl()" will be provided for this.  Note that
      if insufficient buffering is allocated, this flow control may limit
      transmission rate for a given (delay*bandwidth, packetLoss conditions. 
      However, the likely alternative (if flow control is disabled) is that
      reliability would not be perfectly maintained.  Note that  enabling the
      sender "push" option of course overrides the flow control for streams. 
      For file/data objects, the app could choose to  explicitly cancel
      (dequeue) objects or disable the flow control if the app wishes to "push
      ahead" regardless of impact to reliability.  Note that when "pushing",
      NORM strives to provide whatever reliability is possible given the
      buffering/delay/bandwidth constraints the app imposes.
    - Fixed problem with NormServeNode::PassiveRepairCheck() that caused
      NORM to sometimes falsely acknowledge an object that was not yet
      received (Thanks to Jeff Bush for finding this one).
    - Added initial option for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) support
      in "real-world" code.  This includes raw packet capture (via ProtoCap)
      so that ECN header info can be examined and setting ECT-Capable Transport
      (ECT) bits in IP TOS/Trafffic Class header field.
    - Fixed bug in NORM API "NormFileGetName()" call that would overrun buffer
      (Thanks to Adrian Cox)
    - Fixed bug with NORM probe_timer "lockup" when tx_rate is set to 0.0
      (Thanks again to Adrian Cox)
    - Added experimental receiver "real-time" buffer management option.           
      (not yet in API).  Causes receiver to enqueue new data in favor of          
      old, incomplete data when buffer-constrained.  _May_ be useful for          
      apps where receipt of "fresh" data is more important than reliability.      
    - Added "requeue" option to "norm" test app to allow multiple retransmissions 
      of a file to be "stitched" together by a NORM receiver.  See the            
      NormRequeueObject() API call.  Thanks to Keith Hogie/ Ed Criscuolo          
      for suggesting this.                                                        
    - Enhanced NormSetRxPortReuse() behavior when bindSessionToAddr is true       
      such that for unicast sessions a UDP socket "connect()" call is made        
      to effectively "bind" the NormSession rx_socket to the remote               
      unicast addr.  This _should_ enable proper demultiplexing of                
      multiple unicast sessions using the same port.  (Note that this             
      same technique _may_ be adopted in the future for Source-Specific           
      Multicast (SSM) support as well where a NormSession is associated           
      with a specific remote single sender.)                                      
    - Added code to NormServerNode::Activate() so that when a previously          
      INACTIVE remote sender becomes active again (reactivated) that              
      the receiver automatically kicks off a new cycle of self-initiated          
      NACKing for any pending objects.  Note this code applies when               
      the "reactivation" is due to a non-object message (e.g. NORM_CMD)           
      as reception of an object message (NORM_DATA/ NORM_INFO) will               
      re-awaken NACKing as needed anyway.                                         
      (Thanks to Jeff Bush for helping determine the utility of this)             
    - The NORM source code tree has been re-organized.                            
    - Added Python language binding to NORM API, examples, etc                    
      (Thanks to Tom Wambold)                                                     
    - Added WAF build scripts, etc (Thanks again to Tom Wambold)                  
    - iPhone Makefile added (Thanks yet again to Tom Wambold)                     
    - Bug fix to NORM receiver "rx_object_table" and "rx_pending_mask"            
      interplay in NormSenderNode class. (Thanks to Dave Talmage for              
      stressing NORM enough to find this)                                         
    - Bug fix with parsing of "limit" command in normApp.cpp                      
      (Thanks again to Dave Talmage)                                              
    - Fixed bug in "NormSessionMgr::NewSession()" where a call                    
      was made to NormSession::SetTxPort() that should not                        
      have been!       
    - Changed API calls to use "SetTx-XXX" and "SetRx-XXX" more
      consistently instead of "SetTransmit-XXX", etc.  Sorry for
      a change to a couple of key API calls, but this will be
      nicer in the long term.   
    - Fixed problems with NormSession::SenderQueueAppCmd() and 
      NormSession::SenderQueueSquelch() where there as two different
      mis-uses of the NormSession::msg_pool.  Thanks to Richard Edell
      (MITRE) for finding this one.   
    - Fixed problem introduced with new support of multiple "fec_id"
      types (this version) where receiver processing of NORM_CMD
      messages with FecPayloadId content (e.g. FLUSH, SQUELCH, etc)
      _before_ reception of NORM_DATA would result in erroneous
      messages being generated.   
      Thanks again to Richard Edell (MITRE) for identifying this. 
    - Added optional parameter to NormSetCongestionControl() to allow
      NORM-CC operation to collect feedback but NOT actually adjust
      transmission rate.  Also added NORM_TX_RATE_CHANGED notification
      to inform app of when rate change (or suggested change) occurs.  
    - Fixed issue where a small object where INFO was received but no
      DATA was not causing receiver NACK process to start upon FLUSH
      receipt as it should.  (Thanks to John Unger for finding this!)    
    - Updated JAVA JNI binding code courtesy patches from Kenn Fynn
      (Dark Corner Software)          
    - Fixed bug where remote sender fec_id value was not cached when
      only NORM_INFO has been received (thanks to Qingjun Xiao of GSU)  
    - Added NormSetAutoAckingNodes() API call (and underlying code) to
      allow sender acking node list to be "auto populated" based on 
      hearing any message from a receiver (and/or optionally sender).
      Also added NormGetNextAckingNode() API call to allow iteration
      through acking node list to determine status (learn of who is 
      listening, etc).  A feature _may_ be added to notify the
      sender application when new receivers are detected (and added
      to the list) and maybe even allow per-receiver control of whether
      an ACK should be solicited or not.  I.e., the acking node list would
      become more of a "tracked" receiver list.     
    - Added enhanced congestion control feature where the receiver always
      limits the reported rate back to the sender at no more than double
      the observed receive rate.  Adds LIMIT flag to feedback cc flags
      to facilitate this reporting. This is not part of RFC 5740 but not
      incompatible with it ... just works a little better.  In the future,
      another way to do this might be to adjust the reported loss value
      accordingly ... and that would be RFC 5740 compliant although there
      should be an errata or addendum to the RFC for this.
    - Added ECN-based congestion control and simple loss-tolerant
      congestion control options.  These will be better documented and
      perhaps extended in the future.
    - Added extended precision loss estimate reporting by using "RESERVED"
      field in CC feedback extension header.  Again, non-RFC 5740 but
      backwards compatible.  This helps over large bandwidth-delay links
      to get to higher data rates.  Some more work will be done in this area
      such as perhaps returning to some form of slow start (exponential increase)
      behavior after many consecutive RTT with no congestion events.  Probably should
      mirror the return to slow start behavior that occurs when data transmission is
      idle.  This needs to be evaluated as NORM may start being unfairly aggressive
      in such environments.
    - This code has the beginnings of an approach to enable automated population
      of the sender "acking node list"
    - This code release needs to be more fully documented, but was important
      to get online since it has _many_ improvements over the prior 
      "stable release"
                             
     

Version 1.4b3
=============
    - Fixed many (hopefully all) cases where NORM_DATA message FLAG_REPAIR
      was not always being set when it should resulting in receivers
      sometimes "syncing" (or "re-syncing") to sender repair transmissions
      when they shouldn't ... sometimes resulting in duplicative stream
      data being delivered to the receiver app.
    - Fixed case when repair request for old NORM_OBJECT_STREAM segment could
      lockup advancement of stream when stream "push" is enabled.
      (Thanks to Greg Lauer, Clifton Lin, BAE Systems CBMANET team)
    - Added command-line options to "norm" demo app for "txrobustfactor"
      and "rxrobustfactor"
    - Added "NormNodeFreeBuffers()" API call and changed NORM behavior
      to require app to free buffers allocate for remote sender unless
      indefinite persistence is desired.
    - Added "rxpersist" command-line option to "norm" demo app to make
      "norm" demo app receivers keep full state on remote senders' 
      indefinitely.
    - Fixed issue with NormSession::QueueTxObject() where ASSERT() failure
      occurred depending upon previous tx object enqueue/dequeue history
      (Thanks to Jeff Bush for finding this one)
    - Changed repeated scheduling of receiver remote sender inactivity
      timer to ensure that busy CPU doesn't result in premature 
      inactivity indication.
    - Fixed issue with fix for stream lockup problem from below.
      (this is in version 1.4b3a)
      
Version 1.4b2
=============
    - Fixed bug where NormObjectCancel() usage could result in extra
      "release" of reference to NormObject
      (Thanks to Alan McKechnie)
    - Fixed minor issue with "repeatcount" command of "normApp.cpp"
      where only the abbreviated command "repeat" was accepted.
      (Thanks to Deric Sullivan)
    - Added NormSetTxRobustFactor(), NormSetDefaultRxRobustFactor(), and
      NormNodeSetRobustFactor() API calls
    - Fixed issue with CC_INACTIVE being prematurely declared and modified
      NORM RxSocketHandler to read a maximum of 100 consecutive packets
      from socket at a time (This makes sure that receivers service timeouts,
      provide feedback more timely, etc)
      (Thanks to Peter Lu)
    - Fixed case when repair request for old NORM_OBJECT_STREAM segment could
      lockup advancement of stream.
      (Also thanks to Peter Lu)

Version 1.4b1
=============
    - Fixed condition where receivers kept state for remote senders "stuck"
      with CC feedback (cc_enable) even if newer NORM_CMD(CC) messages
      indicate that sender CC operation has been disabled.
    - Fixed error in NormSession::SetTOS() method that transmogrifried the
      default TTL value into TOS under certain conditions.
      (thanks to Ron in 't Velt yet again for finding this and the one above).
    - Made NormFile read/write more persistent (e.g. when EINT occurs)
    - Fixed NormObject::PassiveRepairCheck() bug that incorrectly reported
      no repair needed when in fact, the last segment was missing.
    - Fixed ProtoSlidingBitmask error that interfered with proper 
      sender stream advancement under severe conditions
    - NORM still used old "MDP" FEC codecs but now explicitly check for
      FEC ID == 129 and FEC instance id == 0.  Can be built with
      -DASSUME_MDP_FEC to avoid this check in case of backward compatbility
      issue.  Future NORM release will be using new FEC implementation
      for Reed-Solomon coding but will continue to support compile-time
      backwards compatibility option to use old MDP FEC encoder.
    - Added "lowDelay" and other options to "norm" demo application
    - Modified "lowDelay" option for silent receiver use to allow
      control of FEC block delay (how many blocks to wait before passing
      partially-received coding blocks to application).
    - Added "Norm Pre-Coder" (NPC) utility to distribution.

Version 1.3b9
=============
    - Fixed ProtoSocket WINVER stuff and NormApplicationMsg::SetContent()
      (thanks to Stefan Titze for these)
    - Fixed issue in NormSession::OnRepairTimeout() where a debug 
      message erroneously dereferenced a NormObject pointer as
      NormFileObject (led to run-time issue in optimized code build)
      (thanks to Charlie Davis once again)
    - Fixed places where NORM_CMD(FLUSH/SQUELCH) messages didn't have
      FEC source block length properly set (thanks to Ron in 't Velt)
    - Fixed misuse of "delete" operator where "delete[]" should have 
      been used instead in "normEncoder.cpp" (thanks to Jon of Totient?)
    - Fixed error in NormQuantizeRate() and NormUnQuantizeRate() functions
      in "normMessage.h".  (Thanks to Julian Onions for getting it right
      in the Ethereal NORM dissector he created).
    - Fixed case in NormObject::NextServerMsg() where old recovered block
      could cause assertion failure (thanks to John Wood for the stress testing)
    - Fixed "normApi.cpp" code that was resulting in NormServerNode reference
      counts not being updated properly (thanks to Jon Dyte for this)
    - Fixed missed initialization of NormServerNode::nominal_packet_count and
      NormLossEstimator2::init members (Thanks to Jon Dyte again).
    - Fixed bug where NORM_DATA messages containing FEC parity content had
      8 bytes of extraneous content appended in their payload (Thanks to
      Jon Jannucci for finding this one).
    - Fixed bug where receiver loss estimate returning to ZERO could result
      in a floating point exception in NormSession::CalculateRate()
      (thanks to Ian Downard for finding this one)
    - Re-ordered NORM_DATA "payload_length" and "payload_msg_start" fields
      to be consistent with revised NORM spec.
    - Corrected the detection of "data loss" when application (or API)
      fails to consume received stream data before it is discarded.
    - Fixed bug where when small "txbuffersize" was set for sender, but
      a relatively large FEC block size was kept, the sender app would 
      not be notified by stream "vacancy"
    - Fixed bug with initialization of grtt_estimate when NormSetTransmitRate()
      was called _before_ NormStartSender()
    - Fixed intermediate issue where flush_timer mis-scheduling caused
      sender to "hang" (Thanks to Scott Bates for quickly noticing this)
    
Version 1.3b8
=============
    - Fixed implementation of NormQuantizeGroupSize() in "normMessage.h"
      (Thanks to David Lucas for finding the bug)
    - Fixed some issues with NORM/Protolib ns-2 support
    - Added API NormGetGrtt() and NormNodeGetGrtt() calls
      to support some application needs.
    - Modified transmission of FEC parity segments such that their
      length is only as big as needed to support the maximum
      sent segment size for the associated block (this allows more
      latitude for stream apps in setting their sender segment
      size and flushing).
    - Added NORM_CC_ACTIVE and NORM_CC_INACTIVE notifications to indicate
      whether receivers are actively providing congestion control feedback
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for the great suggestion)
    - Fixed some floating-point exceptions that could occur in receiver
      congestion control tracking under extreme circumstances.  This included
      enhancement of receiver receive rate tracking.
      (Thanks to Ian Downard for finding these issues)
    - Changed naming of "SERVER" notifications in API to "SENDER"
      notifications to be consistent with the rest of API.
    - Debug statistics now indicate correct nack/suppressed counts
      for silent receiver operation (i.e. none)
    - Refined activity timeout of remote sender
      (still need to give the app more control over resource allocation)

Version 1.3b7
=============
    - Deprecated NORM stream payload flags in favor of "payload_msg_start"
      field per revised NORM specification (draft-ietf-rmt-pi-nom-revised-00)
      This included interpreting NORM_DATA (source segment) messages for
      NORM_OBJECT_STREAM with "payload_len" field value of ZERO as
      "stream control" messages where the "payload_msg_start" field serves
      as the stream control message type indications.  The "End-of-Stream"  
      control message consists of "payload_msg_start" = 0 
      when "payload_len" = 0.  No other stream control messages are yet
      defined.  The next revision of the NORM spec will describe this.
      (Thus for NORM stream purposes, this NORM version is _not_ interoperable 
      with previous versions)
    - Fixed problem where NormServerNode "retrieval_pool" had allocated
      segments one byte too small (although this is OBE with the above
      deprecation of stream flags which is what the byte was used for)
    - Fixed bug where sender objects were not properly "closed" when the
      object table was cleaned upon NormStopSender()
    - Added support to VC++ .Net workspace for building "Norm.dll"
      (NORM as a dynamic linked library) and similarly added option
      to build "libnorm.dylib" for MacOS. ("libnorm.so" for other
      Unix platforms should already work).
    - Fixed NormSetTOS() call.
    - Added option to NormSetPortReuse() to maintain INADDR_ANY binding
      if desired.
    - Refined management of NORM sender stream buffer so sender wouldn't
      prematurely discard buffer stream blocks when alot of small
      segments (smaller than segment_size) were buffered.
    - Added NormStopInstance() call to provide means for multi-threaded
      NORM apps to stop the NORM protocol engine and awake any other thread
      blocked on NormGetNextEvent() to signal shutdown of NormInstance.
    - Also updated code so ns-2 build works and tested w/ ns-2.29

Version 1.3b6
=============
    - Fixed some oversite bugs that crept in with changes in 1.3b5
      (Fixed code related to NormNode/NormObject retain and release)
    - Changed NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY posting behavior to be less chatty.
      NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY now posted _only_ after a call to 
      NormStreamWrite() fails to fulfill a full write request
      (i.e. returns less than the "numBytes" requested to be written)
      This helps prevent build up of these notifications in multi-
      threaded applications that write to a stream in a different
      thread than is fetching events via NormGetNextEvent().
    - Added NORM_TX_WATERMARK_COMPLETED notification and NormGetAckingStatus()
      function to provide API support for optional positive acknowledgment
      (ACK) collection in NORM implementation.  Note that use of
      NormAddAckingNode(session, NORM_NODE_NONE) enables a NACK-based
      watermark flushing concurrent with ongoing data transmission that
      can be used as a scalable application-level flow control mechanism.
  
Version 1.3b5
=============
    - Changed ProtoSocket::GetInterfaceAddress() and related methods on Win32
      to use different system APIs depending on Windows version.  
    - Fixed some details related to compilation with g++ 4.x.
    - Various issues fixed thanks to input from Timothy Chaplin.
    - Fixed some issues where attempt to resync rx stream after long
      outages (at high data rates) called assertion failures
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for finding this one)
    - Fixed problem where, on Win32, the sender GRTT estimate was not
      being updated (in the downward direction) properly.
    - Changes to Protolib & Norm to support build of shared libraries
      (Thanks to Dave Talmage & Timothy Mann)
    - Added "NormSetRxPortReuse()" API and code support to allow 
      (with care) multiple NORM instances on the same host.
    - Fixes to NORM congestion control including:
      1) measurement of "recv_rate" at low transmission rates
         fixed (made sure measurement was over sufficient
         interval at low rates including cc startup)
      2) Re-instated code to reduce rate when feedback stopped
         being received.
      3) Changed to time-based aging of feedback to "deactivate"
         stale congestion control feedback representative state
         kept by sender.
      4) Fixed mis-set of PLR flag as CLR flag and fixed bug
         in updating CC node list upon CC feedback reception.
      (Thanks to Praveen Gopala for prompting all of this)
    - Fixes for Win32 large file support "in normFile.cpp"
      (Thanks to Titze Stefan for this fix).
    - Added "NormSetGrttMax()", "NormSetGrttProbingMode()",
      and "NormSetGrttProbingInterval()" APIs to control
      NORM GRTT measurement/estimation process.
      (Thanks to Dave Lucas for prompting me here)
    - Changed posting of NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY for streams such
      that new postings of this event are made, _only_ after a
      successful call to NormStreamWrite() ... This results in
      reduced posting of unnecessary vacancy events, but now the
      onus is on the app to pay attention to this event, since
      another of it's type won't be posted until the app calls
      NormStreamWrite() with non-zero content length.
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for bringing this to my attention) 
    - Made sure messages from self are ignored unless loopback
      is explicitly enabled (see NormSetLoopback()) even for
      operating systems whose ProtoSocket::SetLoopback() doesn't
      work properly.

Version 1.3b4
=============
    - Added NormSetTxCacheBounds(), see NormDevGuide for details
    - Fixed issue with NormStreamSeekMsgStart() that crept in
      somehow (Thanks to Jody Hagins for finding it).
    - Added code to check that NormFileEnqueue() argument is
      actually a file and not a directory name (Thanks to
      Charlie Shyr for finding this)
    - Fixed NormSession::Open() so that IPv6 works
    
Version 1.3b3
=============
    - Added NORM_TX_FLUSH_COMPLETE notification so the sender app
      can make an educated guess as to when his receivers are
      all happy.
    - Added NORM API sample code in "examples" directory.
    - Added NormObjectGetBytesPending() call for receivers to
      use to monitor reception progress.

Version 1.3b2
=============
    - Added "graceful" stream shutdown option to
      NORM API via the NormStreamClose() call.
    - Embedded FLAG_STREAM_END flag in "payload_reserved"
      field of NORM_DATA messages.  This is beyond 
      the current RFC 3940 spec for NORM, but probably
      something to push for addition to the next revision
      of the spec.
    - Embedded equivalent FLAG_MSG_START in "payload_reserved"
      field of NORM_DATA messages.  This allows message
      boundary recovery for streams upon FEC decoding.
      Again, this is "beyond" the current NORM spec, but
      probably a good idea (Other stream control functions
      might use this field as well)
    - Added Visual Studio .NET project files

Version 1.3b1
=============
    - Prevented pile-up of TX_QUEUE_VACANCY notifications
    - Fix/optimization to ProtoDispatcher threaded operation
      to prevent possible (although minor) race condition
      during threaded operation.
    - Added NORM API calls: NormSetTxSocketBuffer(), 
      NormSetRxSocketBuffer(), NormSetUserData(), 
      NormGetUserData(), and implemented overlooked
      NormGetDescriptor()
    - Thanks again to Charlie Davis for finding some
      performance deficiencies.

Version 1.2b9
=============
    - Fixed bugs with NormServerNode::retrieval_pool mgmnt
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for tracking these down!!!)
    - Changed ProtoDispatcher thread stuff so threads
      (e.g. the NORM API thread) are only actively
      signaled and interrupted when absolutely necessary
    - Added support for NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY notification
       (for NORM_OBJECT_STREAM only at the moment)
    
Version 1.2b8
=============
    - Fixed bug introduced during "alignment" changes
      in previous release.
    - Fixed Protolib WIN32 build issue
    
Version 1.2b7
=============
    - Changed normMessage.[h|cpp] to fix alignment issues
      (and other alignment stuff)
    - Fixed bug in NormCmdCCMsg::Iterator::GetNextNode()
      (might significantly help CC performance
    - Fixed NormServerNode::FreeBuffers() bug which
      could result in seg fault on remote server timeout
      or at app shutdown
    - Fixed bug where tx_sequence count was being
      incremented for all transmitted messages (The "fix"
      does not yet address separate increment of messages
      sent to different addresses, etc). The bug impacted
      congestion control performance when nodes acted as
      sender _and_ receiver (caused receives to overestimate
      packet loss)
    
Version 1.2b6
=============
    - Added normApi.cpp into libNorm.a (Norm.lib (WIN32)) builds
    - Fixed Solaris build (new protolib code)
    - Included very rough user's guide for "norm" demo app
    
Version 1.2b5
=============
    - Initial release with theoretically-working API 
      (including "Norm Developer's Guide!")

Version 1.2b4
=============
    - Finally remembered to update this file!
    - Added "help" command to "norm" demo app (Thanks Marinho Barcellos!)
    - New rxbuffer mgmnt scheme to better use limited buffer space.
    - Removed explicit rate limit on receiver feedback messages
    - API more complete and established better API naming conventions
      (documentation soon to follow, I promise!)
    - There have been some "cc" tweaks and bug fixes.  
    - NORM RFC 3940 was released and this version is in compliance.
    - Added optional positive acknowledgements for sender-defined
      "watermarks".
    - Fixed multicast leave problem when interfaceName was used for join
    
Version 1.1b9
=============
    - There have been a number of bug fixes since 1.1b3.  This release
      fixes a bug in NormBlockBuffer::Remove() and 
      NormObjectBuffer::Remove(). (Thanks Thava!)
      
Version 1.1b3
=============
    - Started keeping version history.  This release includes
      some bug fixes, smoother congestion control operation, etc
      over some of the earlier releases.
