This directoy contains Android Studio project files for building the NORM
library for Android.

TO BUILD:

./gradlew build

The lib/build/ directory will contain the binary libraries built.

The "./gradlew clean" command can be used to delete the files built.

This directory may also be opened as an Android Studio project and built from
the IDE GUI.

This will evolve as we update NORM and associated projects to the newer Android
Studio tool chain.
